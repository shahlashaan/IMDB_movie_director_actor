# 🎬 IMDb Director-Actor Network Analysis

This project explores the collaboration patterns between directors and actors using IMDb data and visualizes the results using network analysis in **Gephi**.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze whether directors consistently work with a similar set of actors, by building a network graph where:
- **Nodes** represent directors and actors.
- **Edges** represent collaborations between them (i.e., a director casting an actor in a movie).
